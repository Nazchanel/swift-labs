## Exercise - Extensions
 
 Define an extension to `Character` that includes a function `isVowel()`. The function returns `true` if the character is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u), and `false` otherwise. Be sure to properly handle uppercase and lowercase characters.
 */


//:  Create two `Character` constants, `myVowel` and `myConsonant`, and set them to a vowel and a consonant, respectively. Use the `isVowel()` methods on each constant to determine whether or not it's a vowel.


//:  Create a `Rectangle` struct with two variable properties, `length` and `width`, both of type `Double`. Below the definition, write an extension to `Rectangle` that includes a function, `halved()`. This function returns a new `Rectangle` instance with half the length and half the width of the original rectangle.


/*:
 Within the existing `Rectangle` extension, add a new mutating function, `half()`, which updates the original rectangle to have half the length and half the width. Use the `halved()` function as part of the implementation for `half()`.
 
 Below, create a variable `Rectangle` called `myRectangle`, and set its length to 10 and its width to 5. Create a second instance, `mySmallerRectangle`, that's the result of calling `halved()` on `myRectangle`. Then update the values of `myRectangle` by calling `half()` on itself. Print each of the instances.
